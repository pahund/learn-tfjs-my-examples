# Learning TensorFlow.js – My Examples

Patrick's examples developed while reading Gant Laborde's book “Learning TensorFlow.js”.

## Running the examples

Use `yarn once` to run an example once.

```shell
yarn once src/user-music-genre-rating
```

The `js` file extension can be omitted, but you need to specify the directory (`src`)

### Watch mode

Use `yarn watch` to run the examples in file watching mode. The specified script will run once, then again when any files are changed.

```shell
yarn watch src/user-music-genre-rating
```
